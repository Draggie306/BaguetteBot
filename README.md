# BaguetteBot
BaguetteBot/DraggieBot is a Discord bot.

Currently, this is not intended for public use as it's designed for a small, private server and run for a few hours a day on my local PC. However, if you want to add it to your
own server, then feel free to do so. I'd like to make it more public in the future with more controls on a server-level basis.

If there's an issue with it in Discord or a blindingly obvious issue in the code, please add it as an issue! This will help so much :)
