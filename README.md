BaguetteBot/DraggieBot is a Discord bot.


Read v1's patch notes [here](https://www.ibaguette.com/p/baguettebot-v1-patch-notes.html)!

I'd like to make it more publicly accessible in the future with more controls on a server-level basis.

If there's an issue with it in Discord or a blindingly obvious issue in the code, please add it as an issue! This will help so much :)

Invite the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=792850689533542420&permissions=8&scope=bot)
